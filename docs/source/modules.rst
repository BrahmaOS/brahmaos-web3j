Modules
=======

To provide greater flexibility for developers wishing to work with web3j, the project is made up
of a number of modules.

In dependency order, they are as follows:

* utils -  Minimal set of utility classes
* rlp - Recursive Length Prefix (RLP) encoders
* abi - Application Binary Interface (ABI) encoders
* crypto - cryptographic library for for transaction signing and key/wallet management in Ethereum
* tuples - Simple tuples library
* core - Much like the previous web3j core artifact without the code generators
* codegen - code generators
* console - command-line tools

The below modules only depend on the core module.

* geth - Geth specific JSON-RPC module
* parity - Parity specific JSON-RPC module
* infura - Infura specific HTTP header support

For most use cases (interacting with the network and smart contracts) the *core* module should be
all you need. The dependencies of the core module are very granular and only likely to be of use
if your project is focussed on a very specific interaction with the Ethereum network (such as
ABI/RLP encoding, transaction signing but not submission, etc).

All modules are published to both Maven Central and Bintray, with the published artifact names
using the names listed above, i.e.:

For Java:
  org.web3j:<module-name>:<version>

For Android:
  org.web3j:<module-name>:<version>-android
